Spread across just 3,702 km, Goa lies in the Konkan region. It is a far cry from the hippie haven or a beach getaway, and one of the only few destinations that is open 24x7. The laid-backness (susegad) of Goa attracts as many international tourists as it does Indians, or even more so.The Goans are quite friendly towards tourists and celebrate many festivals throughout the year, the most famous being the New Year and Goa Carnival. While the seafood is excellent, Goa has one of the best nightlife in India with trendy bars, beach shacks, elegant cafes and many clubs and discotheques. Thanks to lower alcohol prices in the state, Goa is also great for younger tourists with relatively tighter pockets.",

Its charm may seem ubiquitous at first, hidden along large buildings and business centres, but Osaka offers delights for all kinds of people- from the connoisseurs to children.Osaka, may at first sight, seem like any other ordinary metropolis- with large concrete buildings and busy professionals, large signs and bustling traffic- but it is so much more. Osaka, in its heyday, was Japans economic centre, and has a rich history, and, it goes without saying, something for everyone. Whether it is the Universal Studios, the thousands of pachinko machines and arcades, or cultural remnants and beautiful riversides, Osaka has it all.",

Boasting of picturesque Japanese architecture and traditional geishas, Kyoto also has a diverse range of cuisine, enough to delight the most seasoned connoisseur.",

It is a very important global financial centre and also the busiest container port in the world. The Pudong area skyline is a testament to this dominance of Shanghai as China's financial centre, with some of the tallest structures in the world such as the Shanghai Tower, the Shanghai World Financial Centre and the Jin Mao Tower.Not just economically, but Shanghai is a historically important city too, around 2000 years old. And this makes the city a very popular tourist attraction as well. Many of the city's tourist attractions such as the Lunghua Temple, the City God Temple and the Bund go centuries back. But what makes Shanghai a true cultural fusion is the fact that it has evolved so much beyond that and yet has held on to it's roots.",
